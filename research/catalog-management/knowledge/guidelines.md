# Literature Review Guidelines

A literature review in a thesis is a structured overview of the existing research relevant to your topic. Its job is to show what’s already known and where the gaps or debates are.

## What it does
- **Maps the field**: Summarizes key theories, methods, and findings.
- **Evaluates quality**: Compares studies, noting strengths, weaknesses, and contradictions.
- **Builds an argument**: Highlight the pros, cons and gaps.

## What it’s not
- A list of article summaries.
- Just background facts.
- A data dump of everything you read.

## Typical structure
- Introduce the scope (what you cover and why).
- Organize by themes, debates, or methods (not one paper at a time).
- Critically analyze (comparisons, limitations, inconsistencies).
- Synthesize into a narrative that shows the gap.
- Conclude with the implications.

## Common pitfalls to avoid
- Being descriptive instead of critical.
- Organizing by author rather than idea/theme.
- Ignoring methodological differences that explain conflicting results.
- Using outdated sources or missing seminal works.
