## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for writing RFCs using the Beckn Protocol RFC Framework. It complements the framework by providing practical guidance, examples, and best practices for creating high-quality RFCs.

### Purpose

- **Practical Guidance**: Step-by-step instructions for RFC creation
- **Quality Assurance**: Best practices for writing clear, complete RFCs
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined process for RFC development
- **Consistency**: Ensure all RFCs follow the same high standards

### Target Audience

- **RFC Authors**: Developers, architects, and technical writers creating RFCs
- **RFC Reviewers**: Technical reviewers and maintainers
- **Stakeholders**: Business and technical stakeholders involved in RFC approval
- **Implementers**: Developers implementing RFC specifications

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before writing an RFC, ensure you have:

1. **Clear Understanding**: Thorough understanding of the problem being solved
2. **Research Complete**: Adequate research on existing solutions and approaches
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Agreement with stakeholders on the need for the RFC
4. **Technical Feasibility**: Confidence that the proposed solution is technically feasible

### Choosing the Right RFC Category

Select the appropriate RFC category based on your content:

#### Standards Track RFCs
- **Use when**: Proposing protocol changes, new APIs, or core specifications
- **Examples**: New API endpoints, data model changes, protocol extensions
- **Template**: `rfc/templates/standards-track-template.md`

#### Informational RFCs
- **Use when**: Providing implementation guidance, best practices, or case studies
- **Examples**: Implementation guides, best practices, real-world examples
- **Template**: `rfc/templates/informational-template.md`

#### Experimental RFCs
- **Use when**: Proposing experimental features or research concepts
- **Examples**: Proof of concepts, research proposals, novel approaches
- **Template**: `rfc/templates/experimental-template.md`

#### Policy RFCs
- **Use when**: Defining governance, security policies, or compliance frameworks
- **Examples**: Network governance, security policies, compliance requirements
- **Template**: `rfc/templates/policy-template.md`

### RFC Numbering

RFCs should follow this numbering scheme:
- **Format**: `BECKN-XXXX` (e.g., BECKN-0001, BECKN-0002)
- **Assignment**: RFC numbers are assigned sequentially
- **Reservation**: Reserve RFC numbers early in the process

## RFC Development Process

### Phase 1: Planning and Research

#### 1.1 Problem Definition
- Clearly define the problem being solved
- Document current limitations or issues
- Identify stakeholders and their needs

#### 1.2 Research and Analysis
- Review existing solutions and approaches
- Analyze related RFCs and specifications
- Identify gaps and opportunities

#### 1.3 Stakeholder Engagement
- Engage with key stakeholders early
- Gather requirements and feedback
- Build consensus on approach

### Phase 2: Draft Creation

#### 2.1 Template Selection
- Choose the appropriate template based on RFC category
- Copy the template to a new file
- Update the header information

#### 2.2 Content Development
- Fill in each section systematically
- Start with the abstract and introduction
- Develop technical specifications
- Add examples and references

#### 2.3 Review and Refinement
- Self-review the draft for completeness
- Check for clarity and consistency
- Validate technical accuracy

### Phase 3: Review and Approval

#### 3.1 Internal Review
- Submit for internal technical review
- Address feedback and comments
- Iterate on the draft

#### 3.2 Community Review
- Publish for community review (minimum 2 weeks)
- Gather feedback from stakeholders
- Address community concerns

#### 3.3 Final Approval
- Submit for final approval
- Address any remaining issues
- Obtain formal approval

## Writing Best Practices

- Include sequence diagrams for flows
- Add architecture diagrams where helpful
- Ensure diagrams are clear and readable

### Documentation Standards

#### References and Links
- Use relative links for internal references
- Include version information for external references
- Validate all links before submission
- Maintain reference accuracy

#### Versioning and Change Tracking
- Use semantic versioning (X.Y.Z)
- Maintain detailed change logs
- Track all modifications
- Document rationale for changes

## Review and Approval

### Review Process
