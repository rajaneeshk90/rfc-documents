You are a senior engineering lead writing a broad, thesis like literature review on **Catalog Management** focused on both **product and service** catalogs. Keep it high-level, practical, and accessible â€” do not dive into heavy math or implementation minutiae.

Primary extra requirement: explicitly cover the **algorithms currently used in production** for catalog discoverability and ranking. **Identify and summarize relevant papers / whitepapers from Amazon, Google, Microsoft or other authoritative sources** (include title, authors/org, year, and URL/DOI where available). Prefer sources from **2015-2025**, but include seminal older work where necessary.

Follow an industry accepted structure for the document.

Tone: practical, concise, easy to read.

get additional context from the files under /knowledge folder.
put the file in /catalog-management directory.

Bear in mind, these are product and service catalogs, not basic web page indexing. 

here is a back of the envelop structure.
    - List down terminnology
    - explain that there is a central service for managing catalogs, called PIM. examples of PIMs.
    - Merchant manages PIM service, how PIMs work. PIM supports catalog upload from merchant, this is canonical catalog.
    - Explain how PIMs produce per-channel views via a feed/adapter layer that transforms, filters and enriches records for each outlet
    - Channel adapters implement channel-specific mapping rules. required fields, local language, legal compliance, images, availability windows (for services), allowed SKUs/service types.
    - Differential publishing patterns:
        - Full export for new SKUs / new services.
        - Incremental/partial update for volatile fields (price, inventory, availability, next-slot) via APIs / feed diffs. This avoids resending full records and reduces propagation latency.
    - list down popular PIMs, MDM((Master Data Management)) / Enterprise catalog systems , Feed/Marketplace Syndication & Channel Managers, 
    - then explain some papers form popular players. algorithms used
