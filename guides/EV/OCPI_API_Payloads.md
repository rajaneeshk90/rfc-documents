## OCPI 2.2.1 API Payloads â€“ Locations, Tariffs, Commands, Sessions, CDRs

Notes:
- Base path and role-specific prefixes vary by party (CPO vs eMSP). Examples use generic paths for clarity (e.g., `/ocpi/2.2/...`).
- Headers (typical): `Authorization: Token <token>`, `X-Request-ID`, `X-Correlation-ID`, `Content-Type: application/json`.
- Pagination: `offset`, `limit` query params; responses include `Link` header and `X-Total-Count`.
- Response wrapper: `{ "data": ..., "status_code": 1000, "status_message": "Success", "timestamp": "..." }` (values illustrative).
