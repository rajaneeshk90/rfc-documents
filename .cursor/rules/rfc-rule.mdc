We are the maintainers of an open source protocol specification called Beckn Protocol.
It is not a product but merely a protocol.
We have been writting guides in  specific ways to help the community implement this protocol.

Now there is a requirement to enhance the way we have been writting our guides. We have been instructed to refer IETF RFC to take inspiration from to write our guides.

below are a set of instructions coming directly from the upper management.

"Long-term deliverable:
Need to have a well-defined framework for RFC writing

Guidelines
 -grammar checks
 -example implementations
 -use cases
 -Versioning
 -Maintenance
 -Evolution
 -Refer to IETF RFCs for inspiration. 

Specification writing requires four things at minimum
Architectural clarity
on-ground engineering insights
domain knowledge
creative writing and articulation skills.
"

Your task is to help us develop a well-defined framework for RFC writing.
